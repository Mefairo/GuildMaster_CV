  Description: 'Bountiful Harvest.

    Perfect weather, a successful season, and
    the hard work of farmers have brought an unprecedented yield. Granaries overflow
    with grain, and markets offer food at laughably low prices.


    Food goods
    are 30% cheaper.

    Selling prices to merchants are increased by 20%.

    Food
    stock is increased by 35%.'
