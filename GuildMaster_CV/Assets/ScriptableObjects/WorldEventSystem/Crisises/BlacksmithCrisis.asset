  Description: "Blacksmiths\u2019 Crisis.\nThe shortage of quality steel and the
    breakdown of the main smeltery have caused a sharp increase in the cost of weapons
    and armor. Even a simple iron blade has now become a luxury, and the forges are
    barely managing to keep up with demand.\n\nBlacksmith goods are 30% more expensive.\nSelling
    prices to Blacksmiths are reduced by 20%.\nBlacksmith stock is reduced by 35%."
