  Description: 'Workshop Crisis.

    A shortage of quality wood and the breakdown
    of the main sawmill have caused furniture and tools to skyrocket in price. Even
    a simple stool is now a luxury, and workshops have switched to crude items made
    from rotting wood.


    Workshop goods are 30% more expensive.

    Selling
    prices to Workshop are reduced by 20%.

    Workshop stock is reduced by 35%.'
